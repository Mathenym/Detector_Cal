    "#### Before we collect data, we need to connect to the digitizer and set desired settings: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Connect to the digitizer by clicking **'add board'** Make sure that **“USB”** is checked and leave all the setting on zero. Then click **“Ok.”** \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the tool bar click the button that looks like a plug (third from right) to connect the digitizer. Once done, the settings window should appear. \n",

    "    * The window may be scaled to large to see that data. Click and drag on the x axis and highlight the area you wish to view. \n",
    "    * It will be easier to see the peaks if you use a log scale. Click the button to the left of the icon that looks like a normal curve.\n",
    "* Collect data for ~30 minutes. (adjust time as needed) \n",
    "* When done, click the red stop button on the tool bar. This will stop data aquisition, and save all of the data. \n",
    "* **BEFORE** closing COMPASS, you need to take a screen shot of the spectrum. Do so by clicking the the **camera** icon in the tool bar. Should look like this:  \n",

Within that folder, create two folders. One titled ‘Figures’ and another titled ‘Run_07-23-2019_filterd_Data’ where you replace date with the current date. **If there is an existing folder for the detector that you are using, you only need to create a new 'run' folder like the one noted above**. \n",
