    "Before opening Compass, you need to turn on the power supply. Simply turn the key on the front of the supply and wait a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the back of the powersupply, there should be a red LED turned on next the the words **Interlock**\n",

    "\n",
    "To disble this light, you need to run the cable running from the power adapter sitting on the table, to the port next to the interlock. **Important: You must do this after the power supply has booted up. If you plug the connetor into the interlock port before you turn the powersupply on, the interlock will not disengage**\n",

    "Now that the interlock is disconnected, we need to connect the power supply to the detector. To do so, plug the BNC cable running from the photomultiplier tube connected to the the detector to any channel on the power supply adapter. \n",

    "Now that the power supply is powerd up and connected to the detector, we need to open software to control it. In the task bar at the bottom, open the program with the red N icon called GECO2020. \n",

    "File -> New Project. The folder you should be in: **C:\\Users\\astropartlab2\\Calibration\\DAQ**. This is where we are going to store data. If a folder for the detector you are using already exists, select that folder and click ok. This tells COMPASS where to store the data. If a folder for the detector does not exsist, you need to create a new folder by clicking the new folder button in the tool bar and naming the folder appropriatly like so: Det_ID\n",
    "The ID can be found on the side of the detector. \n",

Then check the box that says **Energy Cut Enable** You need to also change the energy high cut. I use 10000 just to ensure I am not accidently removing high energy data. **Note: the exact converstion between energy cut and ADC channel is unknown. You might need to play with the cut value until you are not longer recording data in the range you wish to ignore.**\n",

    "    * The window may be scaled to large to see that data. Click and drag on the x axis and highlight the area you wish to view. \n",
    "    * It will be easier to see the peaks if you use a log scale. Click the button to the left of the icon that looks like a normal curve.\n",
    "* Collect data for ~30 minutes. (adjust time as needed) \n",
    "* When done, click the red stop button on the tool bar. This will stop data aquisition, and save all of the data. \n",
    "* **BEFORE** closing COMPASS, you need to take a screen shot of the spectrum. Do so by clicking the the **camera** icon in the tool bar. Should look like this: \n",
